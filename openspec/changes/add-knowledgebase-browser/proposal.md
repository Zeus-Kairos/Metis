## Why
The system needs a knowledgebase browser to allow users to manage their knowledgebase folders and files, including creating, deleting, and opening folders, as well as uploading and deleting files.

## What Changes
- Add knowledgebase browser functionality for managing folders and files
- Allow create, delete, and open folders in knowledgebase
- Allow upload files to specific folders
- Allow delete files from knowledgebase
- Implement API endpoints for knowledgebase and file operations

## Impact
- Affected specs: knowledgebase-browser (new capability), file-upload (modified)
- Affected code: Frontend UI components, API endpoints for knowledgebase operations
