# Product and Solution Cybersecurity

Keysight complies with multinational regulations for the cybersecurity of its
own products and is committed to providing information to assist you in
protecting your products and solutions from external cyber threats. For more
information, see:

and-solution-cyber-security.html>

Keysight also recommends that you secure your IT environments using
appropriate third-party tools. For instruments that run the Microsoft Windows
operating system, Keysight concurs with Microsofts recommendations for
ensuring that the instrument is protected:

  * Get the latest critical Windows updates

  * For network-connected instruments, use an internet firewall (in Keysight instruments, Windows Firewall is enabled by default)

  * For network-connected instruments, use up-to-date antivirus and anti-spyware software

## Responsible Disclosure Program

Keysight recommends that security researchers share the details of any
suspected vulnerabilities across any asset owned, controlled, or operated by
Keysight (or that would reasonably impact the security of Keysight and our
users) using this form:
