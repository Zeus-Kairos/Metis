# Instrument Calibration

* * *

An instrument calibration is a process where the analyzer performance is
measured to ensure that it operates within specifications. If any performance
parameter does not conform to the published specifications, adjustments are
made to bring the performance into conformance.

### Why Should I Get an Instrument Calibrated?

Over time, the active components in the analyzer age and the performance may
degrade or drift.

To ensure that the analyzer is performing to the published specifications, you
should have an instrument calibration performed periodically.

### How Often Should I Get an Instrument Calibrated?

It is your responsibility to determine the calibration period which best meets
your requirements. However, a 12 to 18 month calibration cycle is appropriate
for most users.

There are two things to consider: performance drift and connector wear.

  * The instrument specifications are set to consider the performance drift that may occur over a 24 month period. Therefore, getting the instrument calibrated at 24 month intervals ensures that the analyzer maintains performance within the operating specifications. If you need the analyzer to maintain more consistent operation, you may want to have the instrument calibrated more often than the recommended 24-month interval.

  * Connector wear is a bigger factor and depends on the number of connections that are made. The test ports become noticeably worn after 500 to 700 connections. This could represent about 12 months with average use. With more frequent connections, the calibration cycle should be sooner. You can extend the time between calibrations and thereby save money by using [connector savers](../Tutorials/Connector_Care.md#Concepts_Saver) and by performing proper [Connector Care](../Tutorials/Connector_Care.md).

### How Do I Get an Instrument Calibrated?

To get the instrument calibrated, send it to one of the Keysight Technologies
service centers. See [Technical Support](Tech_Supp.md).

The analyzer must be fully functional when it is sent to the service center,
or they will charge for their repair services. If the analyzer is being used
in a secure environment where the hard drive can not be sent with the
analyzer, a second hard drive must be purchased and configured for use with
the analyzer in an "unclassified" environment before the analyzer is sent to
the service center.

To perform the instrument calibration yourself, you must have the following
required items:

  * Instrument Calibration Test Equipment

  * Performance Test Software

### What Are My Choices of Instrument Calibration?
