perform, but only corrects for a few of the twelve possible systematic error
terms. Frequency response corrections can be made for reflection measurements,
transmission measurements, and isolation measurements.

Calibration, Interpolation A user selectable network analyzer feature that

dB Decibel: a relative unit of measure. The ratio in dB is given by: 10 log10
(P1/P2) where P1 and P2 are the measured powers. The dB is preferred instead
of arithmetic ratios or percentages because when components are connected in
series, their effect on power, expressed in dB, may be arithmetically added
and subtracted. For example, if a 3dB attenuator is connected to a 10dB
amplifier, the net gain of the two components is (-3dB + 10dB = +7dB).

ways of providing signal detection in network analyzers: Diode detectors (used
in broadband applications) and heterodyning, (used in narrowband
applications).

Detector, Diode A device used to convert a RF signal to a proportional DC
level. If the signal is amplitude modulated, the diode strips the RF carrier
signal from the modulation. Many sources used with scalar analyzers are

usually over the same frequency range), and alternate, (the ability to display
more than one trace, each with different frequency range and type).

Display Phase Dynamic Accuracy The phase measurement uncertainty, usually in
degrees, for measurements whose units are in degrees.

Display Points The total number of measurement points made in a single
measurement. The points can be in units of frequency, power, or time. The
number of points often dictates measurement speed, resolution, and aperture.

as monochrome (single color), or color (two or more colors). The format
standard may also be specified, such as VGA or SVGA, for IBM-compatible
personal computers.

Input Attenuator An attenuator between the input connector and the first mixer
of a spectrum analyzer (also called an RF attenuator). The input attenuator is
used to adjust the signal level incident to the first mixer, and to prevent
gain compression due to high-level or broadband signals. It is also used to
set the dynamic range by controlling the degree of internally-generated
distortion. For some analyzers, changing the input attenuator settings changes
the vertical position of the signal on the display, which then changes the

the IF gain is changed to compensate for changes in input attenuator settings.
Because of this, the signals remain stationary on the display, and the
reference level is not changed.

to any of its storage locations. Data can be written to or retrieved from RAM,
but data storage is only temporary. When the power is removed, the information
disappears. User-generated information appearing on a display is RAM data.

ROM Read Only Memory: A storage area that can be read only; it cannot be
written to or altered by the user. In instruments, the storage area that
contains the "brains" or operational programming; the firmware.

Receiver A circuit or system designed for the reception and/or measurement of
signals in a specified frequency spectrum.

Receiver Dynamic Range See Dynamic Range.

Reference Level An instrument function that allows the user to set the
amplitude value at the reference position. On network analyzers, the reference
position is also selectable. On some spectrum analyzers, the reference
position is fixed at the top of the display.

Reference Plane The electrical location at which a network analyzer assumes
the system connectors and fixturing ends and the DUT begins. The reference
plane is set by using calibration standards with known electrical length. The
closer the reference plane is to the device under test (DUT), the better the
characterization of the device because of the elimination of test system
uncertainties.

Reference Receiver In a network analyzer, the receiver that measures signals
as they come out of the source, before they are incident on the test port and
DUT. Typically, these signals are used to compare with the signal at the Test
Port Receiver, to determine the affect that the DUT has on the signal. In a
2-port network analyzer, these are typically named 'R1' (port 1) and 'R2'
(port 2). [See a block diagram](Specs/ManualChoice.md#Block_diag) of the
receivers in your PNA.

Reflection The phenomenon in which a traveling wave strikes a discontinuity
and returns to the original medium.

Reflection Coefficient The ratio of the reflected voltage to the incident
voltage into a transmission line or circuit. If a transmission line is
terminated in its characteristic impedance, the reflection coefficient is
zero. If the line is shorted or open the coefficient is 1. See also Return
Loss and SWR.

Reflection Measurements Measurements that characterize the input and /or
output behavior of the device under test (DUT). Measured as the ratio of the
reflected signal to the incident signal as a function of frequency. Parameters
are called return loss, reflection coefficient, impedance, and standing wave
ratio (SWR), all as a function of frequency. See also S-Parameters.

Remote A mode of operation where another device (or computer) controls an
instrument via the HP-IB. In this mode, the instrument front panel keys are
disabled. Front panel operation is called local operation.

Remote Programming The automatic operation of an instrument by a computer,
usually through a HP-IB, LAN, or RS-232 link.

Resolution The ability of a receiver to resolve two signals.

Resolution Bandwidth The ability of a spectrum analyzer to display adjacent
responses discretely (Hertz, Hertz decibel down). This term is used to
identify the width of the resolution bandwidth filter of a spectrum analyzer
at some level below the minimum insertion loss point (maximum deflection'
point on the display). Typically, it is the 3 dB resolution bandwidth that is
specified, but in some cases the 6 dB resolution bandwidth is specified.

Return Loss The amount of dB that the reflected signal is below the incident
signal. If zero signal is reflected, the impedance of the device is equal to
the characteristic impedance of the transmission system, and return loss is
infinite. If the entire incident signal is reflected, the return loss is zero.
See also S-Parameters, Reflection Coefficient, and SWR.

Reverse Measurement The measurement of a device from output to input.

RF Radio Frequency (from approximately 50 kHz to approximately 3 GHz). Usually
referred to whenever a signal is radiated through the air.

S/N Signal-to-Noise Ratio

Sampler An electronic component that captures the signal level and phase
across a known impedance at a uniform rate. In Network Analyzers, this

measurements. Network analyzers typically have three or four samplers or
mixers.

Sampler Bounce The leakage or crosstalk between a network analyzer's samplers.

of measuring only magnitude.

are met. Each sweep is initiated by pressing an appropriate front panel key,
or by sending a programming command.

Small Signal Gain Compression A situation when the input signal's measured
amplitude is less than its actual level due to overloading of the network
analyzer's input mixer; the analyzer is operating nonlinearly. For broadband
analyzer detectors, a signal other than the one under test can put the
analyzer into this gain compressed mode, thereby making even lower level
signals appear at a lower level than actual. The broadband mode measures all
the power incident to the analyzer, not just the signals at the frequency of
interest.

Smith Chart A graphical mapping of the complex reflection coefficient into
normalized complex impedance. Circles on the chart represent constant
resistance and radiating lines orthogonal to the circles represent constant
