ABORt

Applicable Models: All (Write-only) Stops all sweeps - then resume per current
trigger settings. This command is the same as
[INITtiate:IMMediate](Initiate.md#immed) (restart) except if a channel is
performing a single sweep, ABORt will stop the sweep, but not initiate another
sweep. Learn about [Synchronizing the Analyzer and
