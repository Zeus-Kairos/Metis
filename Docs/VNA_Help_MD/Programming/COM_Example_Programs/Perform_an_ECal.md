# Perform an ECal using COM

* * *

This example uses the
[GuidedCalibration](../COM_Reference/Objects/GuidedCalibration_Object.md)
interface to perform a 2-port ECal calibration.

Learn more about [Reading and Writing Calibration data using
COM.](../Learning_about_COM/Read_and_Write_Calibration_Data_using_COM.htm)

[See Other COM Example Programs](COM_Example_Intro.md)

This VBScript (*.vbs) program can be run as a macro in the VNA. To do this,
copy the following code into a text editor file such as Notepad and save on
the VNA hard drive as ECal.vbs. [Learn how to setup and run the
macro.](../Using_Macros.htm#HowToSetup)
