# Install R&S Drivers

* * *

Rohde and Schwarz NRP-Z power sensors MAY work with the VNA. However, because
there are many factors out of our control, we can not guarantee their
functionality or performance.

Note: VNA firmware before A.09.00.xx will NOT include this capability.
Ideally, the VNA should have the most recent VNA Firmware that is supported by
your VNA.

The following procedure shows how to install the drivers for a R&S NRP-Z
sensor for use with the VNA Source Power Cal and Power Meter-As-Receiver
(PMAR) features:

  1. Download the NRP Toolkit from: [Download Center | Rohde & Schwarz (rohde-schwarz.com)](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/knowledge-center/downloads/download-center_254027.html "https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/knowledge-center/downloads/download-center_254027.html").

  2. Copy and install the file onto the VNA.

  3. Download the appropriate 64-bit driver for the sensor you are using from: [Download Center | Rohde & Schwarz (rohde-schwarz.com)](https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/knowledge-center/downloads/download-center_254027.html "https://www.rohde-schwarz.com/us/knowledge-center/downloads/download-center_254027.html"). Use this version for ALL VNA Operating Systems.

  4. Copy and install the file onto the VNA.

  5. Connect the R&S sensor to a VNA USB port. The Windows New Hardware Wizard will appear.

  6. Select Install the software automatically, then click Next> repeatedly to proceed through the Install wizard. 

  7. After exiting the wizard, the VNA should show the power sensor as available as a USB choice in the configuration dialogs for the Source Power Cal and PMAR dialogs.
