Most VNA dialogs can be made to appear with various amounts of transparency.
This allows you to view the VNA traces through the dialog as you make dialog
settings.

#### How to set Transparency Level

There are three ways to make the transparency level setting: 1\. Right-click
in any non-control area of a dialog that allows transparency to see the
following selections: ![](../assets/images/dialogTransparencyNonTabbed.gif)
