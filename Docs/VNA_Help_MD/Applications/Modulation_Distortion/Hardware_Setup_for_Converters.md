# Hardware Setup for Converters

The following diagram shows a typical hardware setup using an N5182B MXG with
the signal connected to the VNA rear panel Port 1 J10 input connector. Another
method of connecting an N5182B MXG is with the signal connected to the VNA
rear panel Port 1 J9 and connecting J10 to J11. This allows switching between
the MXG and Source 1 without a mechanical switch.
