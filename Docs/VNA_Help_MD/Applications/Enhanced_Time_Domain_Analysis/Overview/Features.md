# Features and Limitations

## Features

The TDR option (S9x011A/B) provides the following features:

  * Up to 67 GHz of bandwidth with 6.66 ps (10%-90%) or 4.73 ps (20%-80%) rise time enables measurement on the latest high speed serial standards

  * Wide dynamic range to observe the true performance of the DUT

  * Low noise floor for accurate and repeatable measurements

  * Fast measurement speed for real-time analysis

  * State-of-the art calibration techniques reduce measurement errors

  * Automatic deskew ensures easy removal of fixture and probe effects

  * Full calibration available for the utmost in measurement accuracy

  * Quickly obtain accurate TDR/TDT and S-parameter measurements

  * Easily locate source of loss, reflections and crosstalk by simultaneous analysis of both time and frequency domain

  * Single connection forward and reverse transmission and reflection measurements

  * All possible modes of operation (single-ended, differential and mode conversion)

  * Measure just the device by utilizing advanced calibration techniques to remove cable, fixtures and probe effects

  * Gain insight into high speed interconnect performance through simulated eye diagram analysis and manual scale of eye diagram

  * Apply industry standard (PRBS, K28.5) or used specified patterns using the virtual bit pattern generator

  * Pre-defined masks for many high speed serial standards

  * No need for pulse generators as the eye diagram is synthesized from measurement results

  * Hot TDR measurement which allows TDR measurement to be performed while the device is powered ON

  * If [LFE](../../../IFAccess/Low_Frequency_Extension/Overview.md) (Low Frequency Extension) is ON, launching TDR will force LFE mode OFF.
  * Millimeter Wave configurations do not support TDR either remotely or from the GUI even if TDR is licensed.
