This section provides links to standard functions.

## For Channel 1

As channel 1 is for VNA-TDR measurements, you can also use some of the
standard VNA functions.

  * [Limit Test](../../../S4_Collect/Use_Limits_to_Test_Devices.md)

## For Channel 2

As the channel 2 can be used as one channel, you can use all of the standard
functions.
