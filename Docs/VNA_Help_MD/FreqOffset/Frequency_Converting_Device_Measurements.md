# Frequency Converting Device Measurements

* * *

Many frequency offset measurements can be made using the VNA with S93080A .
The following is a list of some of those measurements and how they are made.

  * [Conversion Loss](Conversion_Loss.md)

  * [Conversion Compression](conversion_compression.md)

  * [Return Loss and VSWR](Return_Loss_and_VSWR.md)

  * [Isolation](Isolation.md)

  * [Harmonic Distortion](Harmonic_Distortion.md)
