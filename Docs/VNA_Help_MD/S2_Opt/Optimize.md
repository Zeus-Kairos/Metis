# Optimize Measurements

* * *

A measurement has many interdependent settings. You can modify the settings to
achieve the goals of your measurement application: faster throughput or
greater measurement accuracy.

### Increase Measurement Throughput

  * [Achieve Fastest Sweep](Fast_Swp.md)

  * [Switch Between Multiple Measurements](Mult_Meas.md)

  * [Data Transfer Speed](Data_Trnsfr.md)

  * [Using Macros](../Programming/Using_Macros.md)

### Improve Measurement Accuracy

  * [Increase Dynamic Range](Dyn_Rge.md)

  * [Reduce Noise](Trce_Noise.md)

  *     * [Averaging](Trce_Noise.md#averaging)

    * [IFBW](Trce_Noise.md#Variable_IF_Bandwidth)

    * [Smoothing](Trce_Noise.md#Smoothing)

  * [Group Delay](../Tutorials/Group_Delay6_5.md) (Separate Topic)

  * [Improve Phase Measurement Accuracy](Phase_Accy.md)

  * [Improve Accuracy for Electrically Long Devices](Long_Devices.md)

  * [Improve Reflection Accuracy on Low-Loss 2-Port Devices](Refl_Accy.md)

  * [Increase Measurement Stability](Stable.md)

  * [Decrease Receiver Crosstalk](Crosstalk.md)

  * [Reduce the Effects of Test Accessories](Effects_Accy.md)

Caution: Avoid expensive repairs to your analyzer. Read [Electrostatic
Discharge Protection](../Tutorials/esd.htm).
