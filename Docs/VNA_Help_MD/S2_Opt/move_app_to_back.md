# Move App to Back

* * *

When running an external program on the VNA, such as a [support
program](../Support/Support_Overview.htm), the program may have a dialog that
becomes blocked by the VNA application. When this happens, there are several
ways to cause your program to again have focus on top of the VNA. An easy way
to do this is to cause the VNA App to move to the back of the applications.

This operation must be performed each time the VNA application is selected,
which again moves it to the top of another application.
