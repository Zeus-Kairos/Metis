Microsoft Windows on the VNA

The VNA is shipped from the factory with Windows operating system. This OS
supports both 32-bit and 64-bit applications.

### VERY IMPORTANT Protect your hard drive!

The leading cause of VNA failures is problems with the VNA Solid State Drive
(SSD). These problems are usually preventable, and in many cases, recoverable.
Learn more about protecting your VNA.

Using USB

The VNA has USB ports on the front panel and on the rear panel. The main
advantages of USB are hot connects and disconnects and fast data transfer
speeds. Electronic Calibration modules are also available with USB
connections.

The first time you plug a device into a USB port there is some wait time.
Windows reports it is identifying the hardware, then searching for the correct
driver, then installing the driver (if it was found).

Connecting that same device back into that same port later is quick and easy,
but if you move the device to a different USB port, you will have to wait
through the hardware ID and driver search again.

LAN Connections

Windows supports DHCP and fixed IP addressing. Also, Hot connect and
disconnect of the LAN cable, as well as a visual indicator of LAN status in
system tray area, makes LAN connections more intuitive. In addition, the
Hardware Wizard helps users with system hardware configuration.

Mouse Configuration

By default, Windows does not allow you to select to make the button on the
right the one you use for primary functions such as selecting and dragging. To
change any mouse properties, click Start > Control Panel > Mouse. In the Mouse
Properties dialog box, select any settings that you would like to change,
click Apply and then click OK.

Windows Themes

The VNA application is designed for, and best viewed in, Keysight Technologies
theme. To change the theme:

  1. [Minimize the VNA application](../S1_Settings/Customize_Your_Analyzer_Screen.md#Minimize).

  2. Right-click on the Desktop, then click Personalize

  3. Use the scrollbar, then select a Theme.

Printing

Adding a printer should be done outside of the VNA application. [Learn
