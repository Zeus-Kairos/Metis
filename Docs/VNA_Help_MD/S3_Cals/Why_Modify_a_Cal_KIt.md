# Why Modify a Cal Kit

* * *

For most applications, the default calibration kit models provide sufficient
accuracy for your calibration. However, several situations may exist that
would require you to create a custom calibration kit:

  * Using a connector interface different from those used in the predefined calibration kit models.

  * Using standards (or combinations of standards) that are different from the predefined calibration kits. For example, using three offset SHORTs instead of an OPEN, SHORT, and LOAD to perform a 1-port calibration.

  * Improving the accuracy of the models for predefined kits. When the model describes the actual performance of the standard, the calibration is more accurate. For example: A 7 mm LOAD is determined to be 50.4 Ω instead of 50.0 Ω.

  * Modifying the THRU definition when performing a calibration for a non-insertable device.

  * Performing a TRL calibration.
